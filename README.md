## Overview
This project embeds a secret text message into an image's pixel values. The message is hidden by modifying the pixel values in a subtle way. The encryption and decryption processes are secured with a passcode. A graphical user interface (GUI) is built using Tkinter, making it user-friendly.

## Features
- **GUI Interface**: Uses Tkinter for an interactive experience.
- **Encryption**: Hides a secret message within the image.
- **Decryption**: Retrieves the hidden message when the correct passcode is entered.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and other platforms that support Python and Tkinter.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV**: For image processing.
- **Tkinter**: Comes pre-installed with most Python distributions.
- **OS module**: Standard library module for operating system interactions.
